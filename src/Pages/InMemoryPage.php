/**
 * Extendable class for in-memory (or virtual) Hyde pages that are not based on source files.
 *
 * When used in a package, the package developer must ensure that the virtual page is registered
 * with Hyde, usually within the boot method of the package service provider or through a page
 * collection callback in an extension. This is because these pages cannot be discovered
 * automatically since there are no source files to parse.
 *
 * Pages may use literal string contents, a lazy closure, or a Blade view. Contents and views are
 * mutually exclusive. Null constructor values mean that the corresponding source was omitted.
 *
 * Content closures receive the current page as their first argument, which they may declare or omit.
 *
 * This class is especially useful for one-off custom pages. For more advanced use cases, extend this
 * class to add custom methods or override compile() for complete control over page compilation.
