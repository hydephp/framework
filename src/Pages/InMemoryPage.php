/**
 * Extendable class for in-memory (or virtual) Hyde pages that are not based on any source files.
 *
 * When used in a package, it's on the package developer to ensure that the virtual page is registered with Hyde,
 * usually within the boot method of the package's service provider, or a page collection callback in an extension.
 * This is because these pages cannot be discovered by the auto discovery process as there's no source files to parse.
 *
 * This class is especially useful for one-off custom pages. But if your usage grows, or if you want to utilize
 * Hyde autodiscovery, you may benefit from creating a custom page class instead, as that will give you full control.

     * The in-memory page class offers two content options. You can either pass a string to the $contents parameter,
     * Hyde will then save that literally as the page's contents. Alternatively, you can pass a view name to the $view parameter,
     * and Hyde will use that view to render the page contents with the supplied front matter during the static site build process.
     *
     * Note that $contents take precedence over $view, so if you pass both, only $contents will be used.
     * You can also register a macro with the name 'compile' to overload the default compile method.
     *
     * @param  string  $identifier  The identifier of the page. This is used to generate the route key which is used to create the output filename.
     *                              If the identifier for an in-memory page is "foo/bar" the page will be saved to "_site/foo/bar.html".
     *                              You can then also use the route helper to get a link to it by using the route key "foo/bar".
     *                              Take note that the identifier must be unique to prevent overwriting other pages.
     * @param  \Hyde\Markdown\Models\FrontMatter|array  $matter  The front matter of the page. When using the Blade view rendering option,
     *                                                           all this data will be passed to the view rendering engine.
     * @param  string  $contents  The contents of the page. This will be saved as-is to the output file.
     * @param  string  $view  The view key or Blade file for the view to use to render the page contents.
