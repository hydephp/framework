/**
 * Base class for the kernel auto-discovery collections.
 *
 * @template TKey of array-key
 * @template TValue
 *
 * @extends \Illuminate\Support\Collection<TKey, TValue>
 *
 * These collections are the heart of the discovery process.
 *
 * They are responsible for discovering the files, pages, and routes,
 * for the project, and also act as containers for the discovered data.
 *
 * The collections are stored as singletons in the kernel, and can be
 * accessed via the kernel's `getFiles()`, `getPages()`, and `getRoutes()`
 * methods respectively, or through the corresponding facade helper classes.
 *
 * Each collection depends on the earlier one, thus they are booted in sequence.
 *
 * @see \Hyde\Foundation\Kernel\FileCollection Discovers the source files in the project.
 * @see \Hyde\Foundation\Kernel\PageCollection Parses the source files into page objects.
 * @see \Hyde\Foundation\Kernel\RouteCollection Creates route objects from the page objects.
 *
 * The collections are constructed and booted in the kernel through the `BootsHydeKernel` trait.
 * Between the construction and booting is a time-frame where the extensions can hook into
 * the discovery process and add their data through the `runExtensionHandlers` API.
