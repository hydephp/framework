 * When creating a HydePHP extension, you should create a class that extends this one.
 *
 * After registering your implementation with the HydeKernel (usually in a service provider),
 * Hyde will be able to use the information within to integrate your plugin, and to allow you to
 * hook into various parts of the internal application lifecycle, and through that, all aspects of Hyde.
 *
 * Before creating your extension, it will certainly be helpful if you first become familiar
 * with the basic internal architecture of HydePHP, as well as how the auto-discovery system functions.
 *
 * @link https://hydephp.com/docs/master/basic-architecture-concepts
 *
 * It's important that your class is registered before the HydeKernel boots.
 * An excellent place for this is the 'register' method of your extensions service provider,
 * where you call the 'registerExtension' method of the HydeKernel singleton instance,
 * which you can access via the Hyde\Hyde facade, or via the service container.
 *
 * @example `$this->app->make(HydeKernel::class)->registerExtension(MyExtension::class);`
 *
 * @see \Hyde\Framework\Testing\Feature\HydeExtensionTest
