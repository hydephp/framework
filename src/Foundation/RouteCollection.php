/**
 * Pseudo-Router for Hyde.
 *
 * @see \Hyde\Foundation\PageCollection
 * @see \Hyde\Framework\Testing\Feature\RouteTest
 * @see \Hyde\Framework\Testing\Feature\RouteCollectionTest
 *
 * This is not a router in the traditional sense that it decides where to go.
 * Instead, it creates a pre-generated object encapsulating the Hyde autodiscovery.
 *
 * This not only let us emulate Laravel route helpers, but also serve as the
 * canonical source of truth for the vital HydePHP autodiscovery process.
 *
 * The routes defined can then also be used to power the RealtimeCompiler without
 * having to reverse-engineer the source file mapping.
 *
 * Routes are not intended to be added manually, instead the route index is created using
 * the exact same rules as the current autodiscovery process and compiled file output.
 *
 * The route index serves as a multidimensional mapping allowing you to
 * determine where a source file will be compiled to, and where a compiled
 * file was generated from.
